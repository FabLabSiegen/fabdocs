## E-Workshop

### Behavior rules and safety measures

#### Soldering:

Only for briefed persons, note manufacturer's information.

Before starting-up check soldering bolt/station for obvious defects.

All easy flammable substances and item have to be removed from the working area (dust deposit, too).
Workings may only take place on an at least difficult flammable working plate. Never use table-mats, which consists of paper, cardboard or synthetics. The connection cable of the soldering bolt/station and other electrical equipment have to be wired the way, that they do not get in the way with hot pieces accidentally.

Unused soldering tools have to be switched stainless (switch off or pull the power plug). The Ersa-soldering station switch to pause mode independently.

Deposit hot soldering bolts in appropriate retainers. 

Do only use solder and soldering flux from the lab.

Switch suction always on when soldering and adjust flexible arms, that the soldering smoke can be collected. 

When using soldering flux and during soldering works where the distance eye-soldering station is < 0.5m: Use safety glasses.

Do not eat, drink and smoke at the workplace and do not store victuals. Before pausing and after finishing work: Wash your hands.


#### Electric experimental assembly:

Experiments may only performed by persons who are briefed in dangers and appropriate safeguard measures.

For electronic projects, there must not be worked with line voltage in the lab. The maximum voltage has to be 60V direct current and 25V alternating voltage. Exceptions can be made for certified professionals for specific projects, but only with individual agreement.

Before switching on, persons in the direct surrounding have to be warned. 

Setup, conversion and disassembly of experimental assemblies with hazardous contact voltage may only take place in stainless condition. Therefore only appropriate electric tools is to use. 

All voltage-carrying pieces, except of measuring sites have to be covered.

At hazardous-contact pieces, only the leading up of appropriate isolated measuring, testing and adjusting devices is permitted. 

Plug and bolted connections have to be geared to each other in size. Charge indicators have to be checked for impeccable  performance before usage. The usage of mono-polar charge indicators, which are combined with other tools (e.g. screwdriver) is prohibited.  

The permissible net debit is to take in account. The inappropriate repairing of fuses and the usage of higher dimensioned fuses is prohibited. While working with voltage, isolated protective gloves have to be worn. Do not deposit metal pieces at the experimental assembly. 

Safety equipment is located in the lab.

### Maintenance, disposal

Cleaning and especially tidying up (many little components) is very important. Do not perform independent repairs!

#### Dangers for humans and environment

Danger of burning on hot soldering bolt
Increased danger of burning because of hot surfaces.
Because of trickles of hot solder, there is a danger of burnings and injuries. Health hazard when inhaling solder smoke. (lead, tin, colophony)
Electric experimental assemblies: Danger of life because of electric shock. Dander of burning when overloading components or inappropriate connection.

#### Behavior in case of disturbances

Shut down the machine (main switch/power plug), label as "defective", secure against turning back on, inform lab coordination. 


#### Behavior at accidents, in case of danger, first aid

Mind self-protection
Secure danger area and or take persons out of danger area. 
Call first responder/operational paramedic if necessary do an emergency call. 
Give first aid, take care of injured people brief accident ambulance.
Inform lab coordination.
All injuries have to be documented in the accident book.
Fight initial fire with available portable fire extinguisher.
In case of large fire: Emergency Call, leave danger area, warn others.

### The Fablab Traffic Lights

Red: It can be used after completed briefing and agreement of the lab coordinator before every usage.

Yellow: After completed briefing for the device or machine it can be used independently.

Green: After generally security briefing it can be used independently.
