## Lab regulation (draft)

This regulation refers to Fab Lab Siegen ger. "Fabrikationslabor". In the future called "lab" owned by University Siegen. The lab is an open, innovative workshop for the purpose of research and teaching of distributed fabrication infrastructure. 

### Organisation and Coordination

At least two employees of University Siegen will be named as lab-coordinators. These coordinators will get transferred the written duty from the responsible head to take care of rule and security compliant in and around the lab. They also have to Coordinate the teaching and research activities in and around the lab. Because of the citizen-orientated, open, agile character of the lab this is to perform by close and individual agreement with the users of the lab and the section industrial safety of central administration. For the current lab operations the lab coordinators are the main Contact for vaguenesses, exceptions and other concerns. Their orders have to be obeyed. Lab-coordinators at the moment: Oliver Stickel und Dominik Hornung.

## Part A.Basic Rules

### Access and Usage

The Access to the Fab Lab Siegen needs the explicit permission of responsible administration or Lab-Coordination. Exceptions are: 
* Public announced events and/or periodly open Days. 
* Written assigned access permissions. 
* Cleaning and technical staff. 

According to the research and teaching order of Fab Lab Siegen, access and usage of the lab are not only possible for the staff of University Siegen. Furthermore, access is possible for briefed persons with access permission outside normal business hours of the University. In this case, emergency responder have to be present. 


### Guests

For guests who have absolved no briefing: "Just look, don't touch". Deviation is possible in individual cases. For example in workshops, for those the lab will be prepared and secured. (For example no dangerous experimental setup in the lab) Corresponding permissions can be granted by the lab-coordinators and the responsible head. 

### Traffic-Light-System

Usage of available devices and machines is regulated separately from the access to the lab by a Traffic-Light-System. The devices and machines in the lab are tagged.

Green: After generally security briefing it can be used independently. for example hand tool. 

Yellow: After completed briefing for the device or machine it can be used independently. For example 3D-Printers.

Red: After completed briefing and agreement of the lab coordinator before every usage it can be used. For example CNC cutter. 

Devices and machines have to be secured with a key switch or similar of unauthorized use. The classification of the traffic light colors is performed from the lab coordinators in agreement with administration of the University. If the tag is missing for a device it is to treat as red and the lab-coordinators have to be informed. 


### Briefing

All briefings in the lab take place, like any other work briefing, personally and in the lab through lab coordinators or the responsible head named qualified person. The content of the briefings are additionally written fixed on every machine/area and also digitally deposited. Important: Only publicly displayed and signed versions are valid. The digital version are working documents for further collaborative development. Every briefing have to be repeated every year, because infrastructure of the lab could change. Recent briefings are documented as signature in lists in the lab.  


#### General security instructions

All instructions in the lab refer to specific devices and machines, functional areas or other equipment. The exception is the general security instruction, which refers to this lab regulation. According to its character, the general security instruction will be called bellow and in the language use of the lab "basic rules“.
The briefing for the basic rules includes at least:

1. Tour around the Lab 
2. Detailed explanation of part A of the lab regulation. As possible this has to take place on the object. (For example explanation of the traffic-light-system on an tagged device or machine)
3. Short overview of part B of the lab regulation
4. Delivery of a copy of this lab regulation and indoctrination of the duty of complete notice and compliance (incl. part B)
5. Possibility to clarify open questions
6. Confirmation of the briefing by signature in the list in the lab.

The general security instructions are obligatory for participation of other briefings in the lab. 


### Payment and Usage of available materials 

The development of a financing and payment model for the lab is part of research work of the lab. That's why regulations could and should change dynamically. If there are no prices fixed in the lab or online released, the usage of the device or machine is free. In the lab there is a stock, in which everyday devices, no more needed components, segments etc. are stored. They are appropriate tagged. This items are free to use for projects. The condition for this is that the project will be documented an so knowledge will be given back to the community. The extent of the documentation is to adjust to the project. For a small experimental assembly, taking a foto with a short explanation for the website will last. Bigger projects should be documented more extensive. 

### Participation in research activities

Core task of the lab is research about labs itself, digital fabrication, maker culture and topics related questions and to support interested researchers. Current operations and events in and around the Fab Lab will be scientific accompanied for example by observations but also later analysis and published documentations digital and physical artifacts and further researches. It is important, that for the continuous generally research activities no personal data will be collected and all insights will only be used scientific and anonymous. With the participation on here listed general research activities, the users of the lab agree with the recognition of the lab regulation and the briefing in the basic rules. Users can informally writtenly object the participation anytime. During the operation with individual projects, the activities of certain groups and so on can an will be focused for researching interests and getting deepen analyzed.(special research activities). This can only happen with the explicit agreement of all involved persons and the compliance of best research practice. Users of the lab don't agree with the recognition of this lab regulation for participation in special research activities, in which personal project data (for example intellectual property etc.)is special research topic. //letzter Satz unverständlich  

### Coverage

An accident insurance exists for responsible "Unfallkasse NRW" for staff of University Siegen and students, who use the lab for completion of their professional and student tasks which means that a superior or teaching staff has ordered you. All users of the lab are liable for damages, which are caused by inappropriate usage of existing equipment and devices or machines. To cover insurance is recommended. 

Update June 2016

An operation insurance has to be covered. A simple, not cheap solution is to take a traditional insurance. Alternatively it will be checked, if the offer of "Verband der offenen Werkstaetten" suffices(http://www.offene-werkstaetten.org/seite/versicherung) and "Unfallkasse NRW" is discussing if needs of numerous, novel, open workshops and similar places. This will take additional discussion, insights and votes (even though cooperation with Fab Lab Siegen was discussed). Depending on development will go on in the next few months, the lab regulation will be completed with a passage, which represents the final solution. 


## Cleanliness, noise and litter

Users of the Fab Lab Siegen take co-responsibility to keep the lab clean and use tools carefully. After usage, the lab should be in the same good (or even better), clean condition as before started working. This means especially putting used tools away or back to the place where they were stored or, if needed, the independent creation of a new labelled inventory location at in the lab declared places. It is, for example to avoid to create trip hazard of cables, leaking liquids should be swabbed, injury risking experimental assembly, in short: usage of common sense is basic requirement.   

#### Left-behind items

If self-owned items such as components are left behind, without initiative report of the owner at the latest after 48 hours, to the ownership of the lab  and will be stored for public usage. // Satz unverständlich   

#### End of usage

At the end of usage, usage devices should be turned of, if useful and wished. (exceptions are noted at the devices) If multi-day experimental assembly or other large projects are necessary, with agreement of lab coordination exceptional regulations can be arranged. In such cases the section "Arbeitsschutz" of central administration has to be informed.

#### Noise

Because of its location near the town center and the physical closeness of other institutions of University Siegen, it is to considerate third parties concerning the noise level. In case special regulations are necessary, the lab coordinators can independently establish them and hang out in the lab and document them online. 

#### Litter

Common household litter are to throw in the designated waste bins in the lab. For special litter, separate containers are positioned (for example for wooden litter of the milling machine) and have to be used. In case of obscurities, the lab coordinators have to be asked. If there are remains of hazardous material, for example contaminated devices, the lab-coordinators will contact the central administration of University Siegen for further disposal. During common Fab Lab usage this will not be necessary.	

## Children and Teenagers 

Children and teenagers don't have to stay in the lab in general case. Exceptions are special events like workshops with classes. Therefor, supervisors where named by the lab-coordinators, who have to make sure by preparing barriers or shields (e.g. perspex panes) that children and teenagers can't enter the danger area of machines or hazardous substances. The experiments as part of the workshops are to shape fail-safe.

### Supervision of children and teenagers. 

There is a difference between events with children and teenagers as part of their school education and all other types of events. Events as part of the school or professional education are all types of official events of the regarding schools  e.g. in the lab held classes. This doesn't include events hosted by university in free-time e.g Children's University. For events as part of the school education the regulations and agreements of duty of Supervision of the regarding school take effect. All other events: The participation is to deny timely before the event and there has to be at least one supervisor for three children or teenagers in the lab. Supervisors could be parents, who have absolved at least the briefing of basic rules. The transfer of duty of Supervision as part of legal conditions of third parties (e.g. adult siblings) is possible by writing. They also have to absolve at least the briefing of basic rules. The university can't take the duty of supervision, but individual employees or other members of university can take it voluntary. 

### Coverage for children and teenagers

Within the scope of events in the lab as part of school education, there is a legal coverage for children and teenagers

Effective June 2016: 
Addition analogously to the coverages for adults on basal of the final chosen coverage product


### Traffic-Light-System for children and teenagers

For children and teenagers the logic of the traffic-lights system postpones. "Green" may be used, when a supervisor is on the spot and agrees."Yellow" may be used after individual agreement of the lab-coordinators case-by-case. "Red" must not used in any case by children and teenagers. Usage of hazardous substances is forbidden for children and teenagers.    


### Participation on briefings/advanced Training

Children and teenagers may participate after agreement at briefings in the lab. This participations serve the educational mandate and should provide special interested children and teenagers access to special topics. They don't enable individual usage and don't touch the specific regulations for children and teenagers (e.g. the traffic-lights-System) 


## Part B: General safety instructions

### General

Basically, all workings should be performed in the Fab Lab, if at least one other person is present, who doesn't do the same working and who can give first aid or call for help. Exceptions are the usage of the lab for poor danger workings like drawing, working at the computer and light cleaning-up operations. For workings with increased fire and injury risk (e.g. working with buzzsaws, caustic substances, dangerous electric voltage etc. ) the presence of at least one additional person, who doesn't do the same working, is obligatory. In case of vaguenesses the lab-coordinators have to be consulted. For electronic projects, there mustn't be worked with line voltage in the lab. The maximum voltage has to be 60V direct current and 25V alternating voltage. Exceptions can be made for certified professionals for specific projects, but only with individual agreement.

### Clothing/protective equipment

Personal protective equipment is to use. Goggles, earplugs etc. are in labelled boxes and can be used. It's task specific which protective equipment will be used. At all workings where flying around shavings, splashy liquids etc. can emerge, at least a suitable goggle with side protection has to be weared. In case chemicals (e.g. degreasant) are used, protective gloves have to be weared. In case of increased noise exposure, ear protection is to wear. At the milling machines acoustic earmuffs ("Mickey-Mouse"-Headphones) can , if needed, be used elsewhere in the lab and should. A basic principle is: protective equipment have to be optically controlled before usage. Damaged protective equipment mustn't further used. 

Own clothing:
* In the lab there is to wear closed, sturdy shoes. 
*Normal working clothing has to - especially at work with rotating machine parts - fit close. Saucy, gloves, scarfs etc. are forbidden, especially at work with rotating machines (drilling machine etc. ) because of the immense accident risk. 

Variance of the regulations to the own clothing is permitted in the social area of the lab, but only no experiments take place, which can affect this area. 


### Eating, drinking, smoking

* Dining is only permitted in the social area and have to be kept closed.
* Drinks are outside of the social area only permitted in closed bottles and bins.
* Smoking is - as in all rooms of the University - forbidden. Directly in front of the entrance, there is a smoking area. 

### Emergency

Emergency call: central emergency number of the university: -2111 (internal call-through)
Via mobile phone: 0271 740 2111

Here all measures are done. Outside duty hours (Mo-Fr 06-22, Sa 08-12) the call will be transferred to guard duty. 
In case the number can't be reached, the accident ambulance can be called on every telephone of the university via speed calling number 6-112

#### Procedure in case of accidents

- Mind self-protection!
- Secure danger area and or take persons out of danger area. 
- Call first responder/operational paramedic if necessary do an emergency call. 
- Emergency call: to the "Zentrale Leittechnik" of the University, emergency number 2111
- Give first aid, take care of injured people
- Brief accident ambulance (by caretaker or janitor)
- Inform Lab-coordinators
- All (even small) injuries have to be documented in the accident book besides the first-aid-set. Please do always inform the lab-coordinators, even only a small patch is used the stocks have to be filled up.


#### Procedure in case of fire

- Mind self-protection!
- Emergency call: to the "Zentrale Leittechnik" of the University, emergency number 2111
- If possible switch off experimental assemblies and power sources (emergency shutdown fuse)
- In case of initial fire, undertake the attempt to extinguish the fire with appropriate extinguishing agent. In the lab, several fire extinguisher are spread. (e.g. beneath the entrance)
- Keep distance to electric devices/ voltage sources
- In case of large fire, the fire alarm siren will ring. In this case, there is to leave calm immediately by taking the signposted escape routes and to find the alarm post. Close doors and windows, but do not lock them (the fire brigade has to break them), warn other persons and help them to escape, do not use elevators. 
- The nearest alarm post to the fab lab is on the opposite site of the building crossing Kohlbettstrasse, at the parking lot in front of Cafe Planlos  (for more details see escape route planes)
- At the alarm-post, check for completeness.



#### Prevent fire

- All persons in the lab have to know the locations of emergency shutdowns (power/gas) escape route, first aid equipment (ambulance boxes) and fire extinguisher.
- Escape routes have to keep clear in their whole width (doors+windows)
- Highly combustible materials (paper, wood etc.) mustn't deposit on escape routes. Smoking ban has to be attended. 
- Flammable liquids may only be taken to the amount of daily requirement to the workplace. The provision of flammable packing material should not top the needed amount of one work-shift.
- Litter and shavings are regularly to remove.
- Used oily cleaning rags have to be collected in the designated, closed fireproofed containers, because of their self-inflammation-risk.
- At the end of work, there is to take care of switching off lights and electric devices and machines. Except of devices and machines which are used continuously.
- Security communication and fire equipment stay continuously operational and may not be switched off. Windows and doors have to be locked. Burning candles are forbidden in all office and operating rooms, if they are not essential for experimental assemblies. 
- Welding, cutting soldering and metal cutting workings require special security measures (see separate work instructions) 
- The deployment and usage of other than officially provided electric devices are prohibited without special permission. 
- Deficiencies in fire-protection appliance and damages on electric installations as 
indications (flickering light, smell of burning etc.) have to be reported immediately to the lab-coordinators. 
- Blown fuses, defective sockets and power lines may be repaired only by ordered professionals (Dez. 5.2).
- In case of fire on electric devices, the power is to switch off immediately by pushing emergency shutdown, if emergency shutdown does exist. 
- Smoke control doors and fire doors have to be closed permanently, they are not self closing. Doors in the lab have to be closed permanently to prevent in case of fire a dangerous spread of smoke. The usage of wooden wedge or other items to keep doors open is prohibited. 

For details of fire safety regulations see the fire safety regulations of the University Part A und B. 


### Experimental assemblies

#### General

- Experimental assemblies have to be sufficient stable and appropriate for the used temperatures, mechanic movements and maybe chemicals. 
- In case of unattended long time experiments, there is probably to take care of safeguards for incidents (blackout, failure of cooling, unexpectable reactions)
- After an experiment has finished, there is to take care that all connections are closed and the power is switched off. 
- All experimental assemblies have to be organized that they can be transferred by pushing emergency shutdown (or comparable devices) a safe state fastly.
- Experimental assemblies may only taken into operation for the first time according to the traffic lights rules. In case of vaguenesses, an agreement with the lab coordinators has to take place. 

#### Protection of electric dangers

- In case of assembly of electric working funds, there is to take care that these keep undamaged and appropriate for the use-case. In areas where is a possibility of splashy liquids only slash-water-safe devices may be used (e.g. beneath sinks)
- Contact parts with dangerous voltage (e.g. line voltage) never have to be accessible freely. Repair and maintenance work for electric devices may only performed by qualified persons (electrician).

#### Protection of mechanic dangers
- Is there a danger that parts of the experimental assembly will be hurled, there have to be installed a solid protection cover. 
- If there are movements over 10 mm/s there have to been taken protection measures which prevent of reaching into shearing and crushing zones. This can be managed by solid protection covers or an effective barrier around the whole danger area. 
- Special care is to take in areas of against each other rotating rollers, shafts or
parts of gears. Here exists the danger of retraction. This areas are to secure in every case. 
- Before working at the experimental assemblies, take place the regarding motive has to be set still and secured against switching on again. 
- Work with hydraulic or compressed air powered parts of experimental, assemblies only have to be performed if they have made pressureless and secured against pressure build-up. If movements are triggered by the pressure decrease, so this is to prevent by appropriate measures e.g. by arresting the regarding parts or setting in a save position. 
- At work near free-running parts like pendulums, these have to make save against movements or to take down. 


#### Protection against thermic dangers

- While working with stoves, hot work pieces or open flames, it is to take care that in the directly surrounding the are no flammable materials (especially paper and hazardous material). The surface of the working tables should not be flammable or covered with fluxions etc.  
- The workwear should consist of a high share of cotton (synthetic fiber are easy flammable and adhere on the skin) 
- When touching hot pieces there are tools (tongs) to use and fireproofed protection gloves to wear. 

#### Dealing with machines 

- Machines and devices may only take in operation by persons who are briefed in appropriate use by ahead named responsible persons. 
- For dealing with dangerous machines and equipment, operating instructions are created by the lab coordinators, in which the most important protection measures are listed. Mind this operating instructions!
- Machines may only be started if the designated protection does exist and is effective. The manipulation of protection is prohibited and can be prosecuted. 

#### Dealing with hazardous substances

- The dealing with hazardous substances is to limit to the necessary minimum. Containers of hazardous substances have to be labelled clearly with their ingredients and eventually hazard symbols. They have to be closed immediately after use. 
- Containers which are meant for victuals (beverage bottle, compote jars etc.) may not used for hazardous substances.
- Only container have to be chosen which are remaining against the substances. 
- At the workplace (e.g. experimental table) only the daily requirement to max is to store. 
- Because the FabLab is no appropriate hazard laboratory, the usage of hazardous substances is to limit that no health-damaging substances in dangerous quantity are released in the air. 
- At every contact with hazardous substances, there is to take care of appropriate room ventilation (open windows).
- Toxic substances have be kept under wraps. 
- Do never carry (Glass-)Bottles on the bottleneck or lid. When transporting outside the lab, they are to carry always in synthetic boxes, which can collect the hazardous substance in case of leakage. 
- Victuals may not be stored besides hazardous substances (e.g. in the fridge) 
- The consumption of victuals is prohibited while dealing with hazardous substances. 
- For dealing with "hazardous substances“, the above named responsible persons operating instructions are created, in which the most important secure measures and rules of conduct are listed. Mind these operating instructions! 

#### Dealings with gas bottles

- The usage of gas bottles in the lab is only with previous permisson of the lab coordinators permitted. 
- Toxic gases don't have to be used.
- The usage of gas bottles in the lab may only take place for a short time.
- In continoious usage - gas lines are to lay
- The amount of gas bottles in one room is to minimize. 
- Gas bottle have to be secured by a gas bottle holder, steel binder or a chain of falling over. 
- Gas bottles have to be secured of warming
- In rooms in which gas bottles are stored out of secure lockers there has to be a sign at the door, on which type and quantity of the substance are listed
- Gasbottles with corrosive or highly flamable gases should be chosen as small as possible. 
- Rooms in which gas bottles with flamable gases are stored out of secure lockers have to be ventilated probably and equipped with a gas warn device. 
- Gasbottles may only be moved with appropriate transport trolly and unscrewed ventile protecting cap. Carrying bottles is strictly forbidden .
- To remove gas from compressed air bottles only valves and pipes have to be used, which are appropriate for the type of gas and occuring pressure.  - Especially there is to take care that oxygen do not contact with fats and oils and acetyls do not contact with heavy metals like copper or lead. 
- Gasbottle ventiles have to be open only shortly before the start of the experiment (carefully) and to close Directly after the experiment is ending. 
- Before connecting gas bottles the gaskes have to be checked. (or change them)
- Especially while using oxidizing gases the valves have to be free of fat and oil. 
- Gas pipes have to be optically controlled before usage.
- Porous, heavy buckled or damaged gas pipes may not be used. 
- When concerning of gas pipes they have to fit strongly

### Binder for leaking liquids

- Leaking liquids/oils have to sprinkle with sand (location: stock) and take away with hand brush. Hand brushes and other cleaning tools are located also in the stock
- Compressed gas bottles, whose extraction valve can be open by hand have to be labelled and disabled. 

### Unattended experiments 

Unattended experiments may only take place if it is guaranteed, that other persons could not intervene in the experiment or are endangerd by these and that case of blackout or loss of cooling water etc. no dangerous conditions may occur, or increased danger of fire (e.g. by overheating) exists.
