## 3D Printer

Fused deposition modeling (FDM)
Exceptions: Formlabs Form1 + Markforged Mark One, Mark Two


### Behavior rules and safety measures

Usage only by briefed persons permitted. Note manufacturer's information and docs.

Keep the devices clean. Clean the build-plates with alcohol and tissues. Wipe or brush the other parts. Clean the nozzle (of the printers), as appropriate, with a wire brush. Do not insert anything in the opening of nozzle. 

Nozzle for material leakage and the overlying assembly (Hot-End) reach over 200, in some cases 300°C. The building plates can be heated too and getting over 100°C hot. Do not touch while running and check carefully the switched off devices. 

Before starting-up: Optical and manual check: Device clean? Build-Plate free from fat? No obviously loose parts. Belt tension ok? 

Do not preheat! If hot material is for a long time in the nozzle this causes deposit and clog.

The first printed layer is very important. If it does not grip well: Cancel, calibrate printer (the danger of misprints increases otherwise).

Use raw-oil-based synthetic material (e.g. ABS) economically. If possible, use sustainable materials (PLA), especially for prototyping

Not for every piece a 3D print is economic, ecological and makes sense for an engineer. Think first!

If you are working with an unknown printer for the first time, a person who is experienced with the device has to supervise (printers differ from each other).

Do not remove the printed piece immediately after the print has finished. Wait until it has cooled down. Then the piece will loose automatically and the danger of damaging the build-plate will decrease. Do not use a knife for loosing prints! 


#### Exceptions:

Form 1+: Works with liquid raw-material and laser, not like fused deposition modeling printers. Read unconditionally the operating instructions and follow the tips in the docs. For remachining, use gloves and eye protection! Store raw material (UV-ak v) in the dark. During the first 1-2 prints the lab coordination should supervise. 

Markforged Mark One und Mark Two: Special types of fused deposition modeling printers, which can manufacture sandwich materials (nylon, carbon, kevlar, fiberglass, etc.) Details for user regulation will follow, the devices are brand new.




### Maintenance, disposal

Independent safety check and cleaning. Lubrication of fat-carrying pieces, if there is experience in working with mechanics. Otherwise in case of abnormality (squeaking, etc. ) call support. Waste (e.g. misprints) dispose in available containers. (seperate in ABS, PLA and miscellaneous) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Dangers for humans and environment

Burning on hot pieces of the printer and molten raw materials (e.g. hot plastic).
Inconvenient smell when using ABS.
Relatively high energy consumption and possible higher amount of plastic waste (misprints, early prototypes, etc.).  

 

#### Behavior in case of disturbances

Shut down the machine (main switch/power plug), label as "defective", secure against turning back on, inform lab coordination. 


#### Behavior at accidents, in case of danger, first aid

Mind self-protection.
Secure danger area and or take persons out of danger area. 
Call first responder/operational paramedic if necessary do an emergency call. 
Give first aid, take care of injured people brief accident ambulance.
Inform lab coordination.
All injuries have to be documented in the accident book.
Fight initial fire with available portable fire extinguisher.
In case of large fire: Emergency Call, leave danger area, warn others.

### The Fablab Traffic Lights

Red: It can be used after completed briefing and agreement of the lab coordinator before every usage.

Yellow: After completed briefing for the device or machine it can be used independently.

Green: After generally security briefing it can be used independently.
