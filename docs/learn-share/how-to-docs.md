This website represents the central place of documentation for everything going on in and around our Lab. Writing up and documenting what's happening in an interdisciplinary Lab is a challenging thing to do - there are just so many things, experiments, activities and projects going on at the same time. This is why documentation can only be a collaborative effort between all lab users.

## How to contribute

You can contribute to the documentation in the following ways:

**Create a new piece of documentation:** We provide a [documentation starter kit](https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/documentation-starter-kit). This should provide you with everything you need to get started. If you know [how to work with GitHub](#how-to-work-with-github) feel free to do so with the starter kit. If you don't know what this means, you can also just [download](https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/documentation-starter-kit/archive/master.zip) the whole kit and work with it on your computer. However, in order to bring your brand new piece of the documentation online, you will then have to contact us and send it to us (e.g. via e-Mail) if you don't use GitHub yourself. 

**Edit an existing (sub-)website:** Go to the (sub-)page of this website you would like to contribute to and click the "pen" icon. You will be redirected to a web-based editor on GitHub where you can make your changes:

*Note:* You will need a (free) GitHub account to do this.

    ToDo: Some more details needed (do a pull request, etc.)

**Advanced users:** We maintain our documentation [on GitHub](https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/fabdocs). Feel free to contribute and to do pull requests.
